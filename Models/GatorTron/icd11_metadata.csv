Pulmonary toxoplasmosis in the immunodeficient patient may appear in the form of interstitial pneumonitis, necrotizing pneumonitis, consolidation, pleural effusion, or empyema, or all of these.[1]
AIDS patients with Toxoplasma pneumonia present with cough, dyspnoea, and fever. As toxoplasmosis is generally seen only in advanced HIV infection with CD4 counts below 100, the majority of AIDS patients who develop toxoplasma pneumonia already have had previous HIV-associated opportunistic infections. In solid organ transplant patients, this is most commonly due to transplantation of a toxoplasma-seropositive lung or heart into a seronegative recipient, resulting in primary pulmonary disease. In bone marrow transplant patients, pulmonary toxoplasmosis occurs in 0.28% to 0.45% of patients. Unlike solid organ transplant patients, most of these patients have reactivation, not primary disease.[2]

547578362,2B6B,Malignant neoplasms of nasopharynx,"A wide variety of tumours can arise in the nasopharynx, but it is nasopharyngeal carcinoma that has fascinated generations of oncologists, pathologists, scientists and epidemiologists. It shows marked geographic differences, with highest incidence rates in Southern Chinese. In some endemic areas, the incidence has declined by about 30% over the past two decades, suggesting that environmental or lifestyle factors may play a major role and that the disease is, to some extent, preventable. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma shows a very strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, irrespective of the ethnic origin of the patients. This association has pioneered a new paradigm of utilizing viral serological tests for the diagnosis of cancer and for screening in high-risk populations. Naso -pharyngeal carcinoma is generally responsive to radiation therapy, and the clinical outcome has greatly improved over the years, due to refinements in staging and to improved therapy protocols. The unusual and often deceptive histological features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma have generated controversies over the nature of the tumour and still pose a challenge to surgical pathologists. There have possibly been more names invented for the various histological subtypes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma than any other tumour type."

In Western countries, chronic alcohol abuse is a major aetiological factor. Hepatic cholangiocarcinoma has a different geographical distribution, with peak incidences in Northern Thailand.

These features, together with the relative rarity of a number of tumours, can sometimes make diagnosis difficult, despite the abundance of named tumour entities. The increasing use of pre-operative fine needle aspiration biopsies also needs to be taken into account, as artifactual changes may be superimposed on the tumours.

There are currently no clues to the etiology of BPDCN, but its association with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in some cases may suggest a related pathogenesis. Gene expression profiling studies have revealed that the neoplastic cells show a gene expression signature similar to that of resting normal PDCs and closer to that of myeloid than of lymphoid precursors."

In the absence of extramedullary tissue involvement, there must be ?5x109/L monoclonal lymphocytes with a CLL phenotype in the PB. The International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic leukaemia (IWCLL) report requires that the lymphocytosis be present for at least 3 months and also allows for the diagnosis of CLL to be made with lower lymphocyte counts in patients with cytopenias or disease-related symptoms {873A}. Whether patients who would have fulfilled the criteria in the past for CLL but who fulfill the criteria only for monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) are better considered to have low stage CLL or MBL remains to be determined. Some may prefer to still consider many of these cases more like CLL. The term SLL is used for non-leukaemic cases with the tissue morphology and immunophenotype of CLL. The IWCLL definition of SLL requires lymphadenopathy, no cytopenias due to BM infiltration by CLL/SLL and <5x109/L PB B-cells {873A}."

In addition, hybrid tumours, dedifferentiation and the propensity for some benign tumours to progress to malignancy can confound histopathological interpretation. These features, together with the relative rarity of a number of tumours, can sometimes make diagnosis difficult, despite the abundance of named tumour entities. The increasing use of pre-operative fine needle aspiration biopsies also needs to be taken into account, as artifactual changes may be superimposed on the tumours. Unfortunately, the morphological variability of these tumours is mirrored by the immunocytochemical profiles, so that special stains are rarely useful in routine diagnosis of salivary gland epithelial neoplasms."

This can be exacerbated by malabsorption conditions, including coeliac disease and tropical sprue. Pregnant women are at risk for folate deficiency because pregnancy significantly increases the folate requirement, especially during periods of rapid fetal growth (i.e. in the second and third trimester). During lactation, losses of folate in milk also increase the folate requirement. During pregnancy, there is an increased risk of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs), with risk increasing 10-fold as folate status goes from adequate to poor. Between days 21 and 27 post-conception, the neural plate closes to form what will eventually be the spinal cord and cranium. Spina bifida, anencephaly, and other similar conditions are collectively called NTDs.

Clinical findings are: dermatitis, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. The role of EFA during pregnancy and lactation has been highlighted, and the role of long-chain n-3 fatty acids as structural components for the development of the retinal function and central nervous system is now accepted. The prenatal period is a time of increased risk for omega-3 deficiency, as maternal tissue stores tend to decline as they are used for the developing fetus. Deficiency of n-3 EFA can affect growth, and cognitive and visual function in infants. The characteristic signs of deficiency attributed to the n-6 fatty acids are scaly skin rash, increased transepidermal water loss, reduced growth, and elevation of the plasma ratio of eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid. EFA deficiency in special populations has been linked to hematologic disturbances and diminished immune response.

1218193465,6C4C,"Disorders due to use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA","Disorders due to use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA are characterised by the pattern and consequences of MDMA or related drug use. MDMA is methylene-dioxymethamphetamine and is a common drug of abuse in many countries especially among young people. It is predominantly available in tablet form known as ‘ecstasy’. Pharmacologically, MDMA has stimulant and empathogenic properties and these encourage its use among young people for social and other interactions. Considering its wide prevalence in many countries and among many sub-groups of young people, MDMA and Related Drug Dependence and MDMA and Related Drug Withdrawal are comparatively uncommon. Substance-Induced Mental Disorders may arise from its use. Several analogues of MDMA exist, including MDA (methylene-dioxyamphetamine)."

Cannabis contains cannabinoids, a class of diverse chemical compounds that act on endogenous cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitter release in the brain. The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabis is typically smoked in the form of the flowering heads or leaves of the marijuana plant; tobacco is often mixed with cannabis when smoked. There are also cannabis oils that are prepared from these same sources. These preparations vary considerably in their THC potency. Cannabis has predominantly central nervous system depressant effects and produces a characteristic euphoria that may be part of the presenting features of Cannabis Intoxication, which may also include impairment in cognitive and psychomotor functioning. Cannabis has dependence-producing properties resulting in Cannabis Dependence in some people and Cannabis Withdrawal when use is reduced or discontinued. Cannabis is associated with a range of Cannabis-Induced Mental Disorders."

There is pervasive and persistent preoccupation with the symptoms and their consequences to the extent that these may become the focal point of the person’s life, typically resulting in extensive interactions with the health care system. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation cause serious impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., unable to work, alienation of friends and family, abandonment of nearly all social and leisure activities). The person’s interests may become so narrow so as to focus almost exclusively on his or her bodily symptoms and their negative consequences."
263852475,6B80,Anorexia Nervosa,"Anorexia Nervosa is characterised by significantly low body weight for the individual’s height, age and developmental stage that is not due to another health condition or to the unavailability of food. A commonly used threshold is body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m2 in adults and BMI-for-age under 5th percentile in children and adolescents. Rapid weight loss (e.g. more than 20% of total body weight within 6 months) may replace the low body weight guideline as long as other diagnostic requirements are met. Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to gain weight as expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather than weight loss. Low body weight is accompanied by a persistent pattern of behaviours to prevent restoration of normal weight, which may include behaviours aimed at reducing energy intake (restricted eating), purging behaviours (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives), and behaviours aimed at increasing energy expenditure (e.g. excessive exercise), typically associated with a fear of weight gain. Low body weight or shape is central to the person's self-evaluation or is inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive."
1478963582,6C4B.6,Volatile inhalant-induced psychotic disorder,"Volatile inhalant-induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from volatile inhalants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Volatile inhalant intoxication or Volatile inhalant withdrawal. The amount and duration of volatile inhalant use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the volatile inhalant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the volatile inhalant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with volatile inhalant use)."

1991016628,6B24,Hoarding disorder,"Hoarding disorder is characterised by accumulation of possessions that results in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that their use or safety is compromised. Accumulation occurs due to both repetitive urges or behaviours related to amassing items and difficulty discarding possessions due to a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them. If living areas are uncluttered this is only due to the intervention of third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities). Amassment may be passive (e.g. accumulation of incoming flyers or mail) or active (e.g. excessive acquisition of free, purchased, or stolen items). The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."

There are problems in many interpersonal relationships and/or in performance of expected occupational and social roles, but some relationships are maintained and/or some roles carried out. Specific manifestations of personality disturbances are generally of mild severity. Mild Personality Disorder is typically not associated with substantial harm to self or others, but may be associated with substantial distress or with impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning that is either limited to circumscribed areas (e.g., romantic relationships; employment) or present in more areas but milder."

988400777,6B65,Partial dissociative identity disorder,"Partial dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. One personality state is dominant and normally functions in daily life, but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive, affective, perceptual, motor, or behavioural. They are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning, but there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours, such as in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."

The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use MDMA or related drugs, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use MDMA or related drugs. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of MDMA or related drugs, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of MDMA or related drugs, or repeated use of MDMA or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms.

The delusions are variable in content across individuals, but typically stable within individuals, although they may evolve over time. Other characteristic symptoms of Schizophrenia (i.e. clear and persistent hallucinations, negative symptoms, disorganised thinking, or experiences of influence, passivity, or control) are not present, although various forms of perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations, illusions, misidentifications of persons) thematically related to the delusion are still consistent with the diagnosis. Apart from actions and attitudes directly related to the delusion or delusional system, affect, speech, and behavior are typically unaffected. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol withdrawal)."
976174979,6C4B.3,Volatile inhalant intoxication,"Volatile inhalant intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of a volatile inhalant that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of volatile inhalants and their intensity is closely related to the amount of volatile inhalant consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the volatile inhalant is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include euphoria, impaired judgment, aggression, somnolence, stupor or coma, dizziness, tremor, lack of coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy and apathy, psychomotor retardation, and visual disturbances. Muscle weakness and diplopia may occur. Use of volatile inhalants may cause cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and death.

Manifestations of separation anxiety may include thoughts of harm or untoward events befalling the attachment figure, reluctance to go to school or work, recurrent excessive distress upon separation, reluctance or refusal to sleep away from the attachment figure, and recurrent nightmares about separation. The symptoms persist for at least several months and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
284410555,6A23,Acute and transient psychotic disorder,"Acute and transient psychotic disorder is characterised by acute onset of psychotic symptoms that emerge without a prodrome and reach their maximal severity within two weeks. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganisation of thought processes, perplexity or confusion, and disturbances of affect and mood. Catatonia-like psychomotor disturbances may be present. Symptoms typically change rapidly, both in nature and intensity, from day to day, or even within a single day. The duration of the episode does not exceed 3 months, and most commonly lasts from a few days to 1 month. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g. alcohol withdrawal)."

Coordinated motor skills are markedly below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g. in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities). Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not solely attributable to a Disease of the Nervous System, Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, sensory impairment, and not better explained by a Disorder of Intellectual Development."

480277067,6C45.70,Cocaine-induced mood disorder,"Cocaine-induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use)."

These difficulties arise during the developmental period, typically during early childhood, and cause significant limitations in the individual’s ability to communicate. Pragmatic language abilities are markedly below the expected level given the individual’s age and level of intellectual functioning, but the other components of receptive and expressive language are relatively intact. This qualifier should not be used if the pragmatic language impairment is better explained by Autism Spectrum Disorder or by impairments in other components of receptive or expressive language."

The amount and duration of use of the multiple specified substances must be capable of producing delirium. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder, by use of or withdrawal from a substance other than those specified, or by another health condition that is not classified under Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Note that this diagnosis applies only to those situations in which delirium is present but it cannot be determined which of multiple psychoactive substances is the cause of the delirium. In cases of multiple psychoactive substance use in which more than one specific substance can be identified as a cause of the delirium, the corresponding specific substance-induced delirium diagnoses should be given instead."

Characterized by presence of Lewy bodies, which are intraneuronal inclusions containing α-synuclein and ubiquitin in the brain stem, limbic area, forebrain, and neocortex. Onset is insidious with attentional and executive functioning deficits often present. These cognitive deficits are often accompanied by visual hallucinations and symptoms of REM sleep behaviour disorder. Hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depressive symptoms, and delusions may also be present. The symptom presentation usually varies significantly over the course of days necessitating longitudinal assessment and differentiation from delirium.

Alcohol—more specifically termed ethyl alcohol or ethanol—is an intoxicating compound produced by fermentation of sugars usually in agricultural products such as fruits, cereals, and vegetables with or without subsequent distillation. There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a central nervous system depressant. In addition to ability to produce Alcohol Intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing properties, resulting in Alcohol Dependence in some people and Alcohol Withdrawal when alcohol use is reduced or discontinued. Unlike most other substances, elimination of alcohol from the body occurs at a constant rate, such that its clearance follows a linear rather than a logarithmic course. Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from behaviour during Alcohol Intoxication is well recognized and is included in the definitions of harmful use of alcohol (i.e., Episode of Harmful Use of Alcohol and Harmful Pattern of Use of Alcohol). Several alcohol-induced mental disorders (e.g., Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder) and alcohol-related forms of neurocognitive impairment (e.g., Dementia Due to Use of Alcohol) are recognized."

The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use these substances. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use, or repeated use of sedatives or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if sedative use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months."

There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication."

Affected persons possess very limited communication abilities and capacity for acquisition of academic skills is restricted to basic concrete skills. They may also have co-occurring motor and sensory impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd percentile."

At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning in interacting with others or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life such as parenting, or work, or in response to specific situations (e.g., those that are perceived as threatening). Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor control, and behaviour. There are typically episodes of amnesia, which may be severe. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder.

991786158,,Disorders specifically associated with stress,"Disorders specifically associated with stress are directly related to exposure to a stressful or traumatic event, or a series of such events or adverse experiences. For each of the disorders in this grouping, an identifiable stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. Although not all individuals exposed to an identified stressor will develop a disorder, the disorders in this grouping would not have occurred without experiencing the stressor. Stressful events for some disorders in this grouping are within the normal range of life experiences (e.g., divorce, socio-economic problems, bereavement). Other disorders require the experience of a stressor of an extremely threatening or horrific nature (i.e., potentially traumatic events). With all disorders in this grouping, it is the nature, pattern, and duration of the symptoms that arise in response to the stressful events—together with associated functional impairment—that distinguishes the disorders."

The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of disturbances of impulse control that are characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal from the multiple specified psychoactive substances. The amount and duration of the multiple specified psychoactive substances use must be capable of producing disturbances of impulse control. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Impulse control disorder, a Disorder due to addictive behaviours), as might be the case if the impulse control disturbances preceded the onset of the use of multiple specified psychoactive substances, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the multiple specified psychoactive substance use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with impulse control symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with multiple specified psychoactive substances use)."

Synthetic cannabinoids are synthesized diverse chemical compounds that are potent agonists for endogenous cannabinoid receptors. There are several hundred such compounds. The synthetic compound is typically sprayed onto a vehicle such as cannabis or tea leaves and then smoked. The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from smoking naturally cultivated cannabis in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior). Synthetic Cannabinoid Intoxication may therefore present more frequently with psychotic symptoms in addition to the more typical effects of cannabis. Synthetic cannabinoids are also dependence-producing and Synthetic Cannabinoid Dependence and Synthetic Cannabinoid Withdrawal are recognized.

931320871,6C40.23,"Alcohol dependence, sustained partial remission","After a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other intervention (including self-help intervention), there is a significant reduction in alcohol consumption for more than 12 months, such that even though intermittent or continuing drinking has occurred during this period, the definitional requirements for dependence have not been met."
1292252379,6C46.61,"Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone with delusions","Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with use of stimulants)."

1339202943,6C40.3,Alcohol intoxication,"Alcohol intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of alcohol that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of alcohol and their intensity is closely related to the amount of alcohol consumed. They are time-limited and abate as alcohol is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include impaired attention, inappropriate or aggressive behaviour, lability of mood and emotions, impaired judgment, poor coordination, unsteady gait, fine nystagmus and slurred speech. At more severe levels of intoxication, stupor or coma may occur. Alcohol intoxication may facilitate suicidal ideation or behaviour."
111507461,6C43,Disorders due to use of opioids,"Disorders due to use of opioids are characterised by the pattern and consequences of opioid use. Opioids is a generic term that encompasses the constituents or derivatives of the opium poppy Papaver somniferum as well as a range of synthetic and semisynthetic compounds, some related to morphine and others chemically distinct but all having their primary actions on the µ opioid receptor. Examples of opioids include morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), fentanyl, pethidine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine and d-propoxyphene. The opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies and are primarily central nervous system depressants. They suppress respiration as well as other vital functions and are a common cause of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including heroin, a common and potent opioid that is primarily used non-medically. Therapeutic opioids are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in cancer pain and palliative care, although they are also used for non-therapeutic reasons. In some countries morbidity and mortality related to therapeutic opioids is greater than that related to heroin. All opioids may result in Opioid Intoxication, Opioid Dependence and Opioid Withdrawal. A range of Opioid-Induced Disorders occur, some of which occur following Opioid Withdrawal."

Cocaine is a compound found in the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylum coca, which is indigenous to countries in northern regions of South America. Cocaine has a limited place in medical treatment as an anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive agent. It is commonly used illicitly and widely available across the world, where it is found in two main forms: cocaine hydrochloride and cocaine freebase (also known as ‘crack’). Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant, and Cocaine Intoxication typically includes a state of euphoria and hyperactivity. Cocaine has potent dependence-producing properties and Cocaine Dependence is a common cause of morbidity and of clinical presentations. Cocaine Withdrawal has a characteristic course that includes lethargy and depressed mood. A range of Cocaine-Induced Mental Disorders is described."

If only non-mood symptoms of a depressive episode are present (e.g., anhedonia, psychomotor slowing), this descriptor should not be used. This descriptor may be used whether or not depressive symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements of a separately diagnosed Depressive disorder. The rating should be made based on the severity of depressive mood symptoms during the past week."
1582741816,6B20,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is characterised by the presence of persistent obsessions or compulsions, or most commonly both. Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts, images, or impulses/urges that are intrusive, unwanted, and are commonly associated with anxiety. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them by performing compulsions. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours including repetitive mental acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, or to achieve a sense of ‘completeness’. In order for obsessive-compulsive disorder to be diagnosed, obsessions and compulsions must be time consuming (e.g. taking more than an hour per day) or result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
1254916765,7A80,Restless legs syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome is a waking sensorimotor disorder characterised by a complaint of a strong, nearly irresistible urge to move the limbs. This urge to move is often but not always accompanied by other uncomfortable sensations felt deep inside the limbs. Although the legs are most prominently affected, a significant percentage of individuals with Restless legs syndrome describe some arm sensations. The symptoms of Restless legs syndrome are worse at rest, alleviated with movement, and predominant in the evening or night. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep). The vast majority of individuals with Restless legs syndrome also exhibit periodic limb movements during sleep. A separate diagnosis of Periodic limb movement disorder is not warranted in such cases because the limb movements during sleep are considered to be an expected part of Restless legs syndrome."

That is, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin determinations are > 110 picograms per milliliter. Cataplexy is not present. The disorder is not attributable to a disease of the nervous system or other medical condition.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep and multiple sleep latency test/polysomnography (MSLT/PSG) findings characteristic of narcolepsy. There should be no evidence of cataplexy or CSF hypocretin deficiency (if testing is performed)."
217911841,7A85,Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy,"Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy is characterised by repetitive myoclonic jerks that occur during sleep in neonates and infants.

These events are typically associated with physiological compromise (hypoxemia, bradycardia), or the need for intervention such as stimulation or resuscitation. This diagnosis should be assigned when central events are the predominant finding, even if obstructive or mixed apnoeas or hypopneas are also present.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography or alternative monitoring such as hospital or home monitoring."
1180849398,7A22,Kleine-Levin syndrome,"Kleine-Levin syndrome is characterised by recurrent episodes of severe sleepiness in association with cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioural disturbances. A typical episode lasts a median of 10 days (range 2.5–80 days), with rare episodes lasting several weeks to months. During episodes, patients may sleep as long as 16 to 20 hours per day, waking or getting up only to eat and void. When awake during episodes, most patients are exhausted, apathetic, confused, and slow in speaking and answering. Hyperphagia, hypersexuality, childish behaviour, depression, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions are often observed during the episodes. Patients are normal between episodes with regard to sleep, cognition, mood, and eating. Rarely, Kleine Levin syndrome may occur exclusively during menstrual periods."

The experiences are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning or significant risk of injury to the individual or to others."
261208732,7B00.3,Sleep-related eating disorder,Sleep-related eating disorder is characterised by recurrent episodes of involuntary excessive or dangerous eating or drinking that occur during the main sleep period that are not attributable to the effects of a medication or substance. Episodes may involve consumption of peculiar forms or combinations of food or inedible or toxic substances or injurious or potentially injurious behaviours performed while in pursuit of food or while cooking food. There may be adverse health consequences from recurrent nocturnal binge eating of high calorie foods. There is partial or complete amnesia for the events.
230938285,7A42.4,Sleep-related hypoventilation due to a medication or substance,"Sleep-related hypoventilation due to a medication or substance is characterised primarily by chronic hypoventilation and hypercapnia due to prolonged use of medications or substances known to depress ventilatory drive and/or impair respiratory muscle mechanics (e.g. long-acting narcotics, anesthetics, sedative compounds, and muscle relaxants). Hypoxemia is commonly present as well. Hypercapnia may also be present during wakefulness in some patients. Patients can either be asymptomatic or present with complaints of dyspnea, chest tightness, or fatigue.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography with carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring (by arterial, end-tidal or transcutaneous measures) in the context of medication or substance use that is judged to be causing the symptoms."
1193320862,7A40,Central sleep apnoeas,"Central sleep apnoeas are characterised by reduction or cessation of airflow due to absent or reduced respiratory effort. Central apnoea (cessation of airflow) or hypopnea (reduction in airflow) may occur in a cyclical or intermittent fashion. Patients with central sleep apnoea of various etiologies may also exhibit obstructive events, in which case diagnoses of both central sleep apnoea and obstructive sleep apnoea may be given.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
224267797,7A42,Sleep-related hypoventilation or hypoxemia disorders,"The primary feature of these disorders is insufficient sleep related ventilation, resulting in abnormally elevated arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) during sleep. Sleep-related hypoxemia is diagnosed when overnight monitoring reveals sustained (> 5 minutes) decline in oxygen saturation to ≤ 88% in adults (or ≤ 90% in children) for ≥ 5 minutes.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring during sleep (by arterial, end-tidal or transcutaneous measures)."

Multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) demonstrates a mean sleep latency of <8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP’s), or one or more SOREMP’s on MSLT and a SOREMP on the preceding overnight polysomnography (PSG). Nighttime sleep is often disturbed, and brief daytime naps are typically refreshing."
877557231,,Sleep-related breathing disorders,"Sleep related breathing disorders are characterised by abnormalities of respiration during sleep. In some of these disorders, respiration is also abnormal during wakefulness. The disorders are grouped into central sleep apnoeas, obstructive sleep apnoea, and sleep related hypoventilation or hypoxemia disorders."
934354997,7A62,Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder,"Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder is characterised by absence of a clearly-defined cycle of sleep and wake. Sleep becomes distributed in multiple episodes of variable duration throughout the 24-hour period.

The symptoms should have persisted for at least several months and result in significant distress or mental, physical, social, occupational or academic impairment."
453657445,7A40.4,Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition without Cheyne-Stokes breathing,"Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition without Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterised by recurrent, predominantly central apnoeas or central hypopneas (more than five per hour) that are attributed to a medical condition (and do not have the pattern of CSB). The majority of these patients have brainstem lesions of developmental, vascular, neoplastic, degenerative, demyelinating, or traumatic origin. The disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnea, or snoring

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the symptoms."
312051047,7A63,Non-24 hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder,"Non-24 hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder is characterised by periods of insomnia and/or daytime sleepiness, alternating with periods of relatively normal sleep, due to a lack of entrainment of the circadian clock to the 24-hour environmental cycle. The period length of the circadian/sleep-wake cycle is typically longer than 24 hours. Symptoms occur as the circadian-controlled sleep-wake propensity cycles in and out of phase with the environmental day-night cycle. The disorder is seen most commonly in individuals with complete blindness. The symptoms should have persisted for at least several months and result in significant distress or mental, physical, social, occupational or academic impairment."
2012656262,7A40.6,Central sleep apnoea due to a medication or substance,"Central sleep apnoea due to a medication is characterised by a pattern of recurring, predominantly central sleep apnoea or hypopnoea (more than five per hour) that is attributable to a medication or substance, most commonly long-acting opioids (e.g. methadone, long-acting morphine or oxycodone, fentanyl patches). The disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnoea, or snoring. Obstructive apnoeas and hypoventilation may be present, but central sleep apnoea is the predominant finding.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography in the context of medication or substance use that is judged to be causing the symptoms."

335616593,7B00.2,Sleep terrors,"Sleep terrors are characterised by episodes of abrupt terror during a partial arousal from deep sleep, typically beginning with a vocalization such as a frightening scream. The individual experiences intense fear accompanied by signs of autonomic arousal, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis."
1919233290,7A41,Obstructive sleep apnoea,"Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterised by repetitive episodes of apnoea or hypopnea that are caused by upper airway obstruction occurring during sleep. These events often result in reductions in blood oxygen saturation and are usually terminated by brief arousals from sleep. Excessive sleepiness is a major presenting complaint in many but not all cases. Reports of insomnia, poor sleep quality, and fatigue are also common. Upper airway resistance syndrome shares the same pathophysiology and should be classified here. In adults (> 18 years), obstructive sleep apnoea is diagnosed when the frequency of obstructive events (apnoeas, hypopneas or respiratory-event related arousals) is greater than 15 per hour. The disorder may also be diagnosed when the frequency is greater than five per hour and: a) symptoms attributable to the disorder (e.g., sleepiness or sleep disruption) are present; or b) nocturnal respiratory distress or observed apnoea/habitual snoring are reported; or c) when hypertension, a mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus are present. In children, the disorder is diagnosed when the frequency of obstructive events is great than one per hour, accompanied by signs or symptoms related to the breathing disorder.

1832877760,7A01,Short-term insomnia,"Short-term insomnia is characterised by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep of less than 3 months duration that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep and results in general sleep dissatisfaction and some form of daytime impairment. Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder. If the insomnia is due to another sleep-wake disorder, a mental disorder, another medical condition, or a substance or medication, short-term insomnia should only be diagnosed if the insomnia is an independent focus of clinical attention."
941326977,7A40.0,Primary central sleep apnoea,"Primary central sleep apnoea is of unknown etiology (idiopathic) and is characterised by recurrent, predominantly central apnoeas. Airflow and respiratory effort cease simultaneously in a repetitive fashion over the course of the night. The recurrent episodes of apnoea (more than five per hour) and associated arousals are sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnoea, or snoring.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
192130563,7B02,Other parasomnias,"Other parasomnias include Hypnogogic exploding head syndrome, Sleep-related hallucinations, and abnormal sleep related complex movements, behaviours, emotions, perceptions, dreams, or autonomic nervous system activity related to a medical condition or due to a medication or substance. The experiences are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning or significant risk of injury to the individual or to others."
1125130790,7A84,Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder,"Sleep related rhythmic movement disorder is characterised by repetitive, stereotyped, and rhythmic motor behaviours that involve large muscle groups (e.g., banging head against pillow or mattress, head rolling, body rocking, body rolling). The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep) or result in bodily injury (e.g., due to falling out of bed)."
1900730309,7B01.2,Nightmare disorder,"Nightmare disorder is characterised by recurrent, vivid and highly dysphoric dreams, often involving threat to the individual, that generally occur during REM sleep and that often result in awakening with anxiety. The person is rapidly oriented and alert upon awakening."
1378403680,7A65,"Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, jet lag type","Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, jet lag type is characterised by a temporary mismatch between the timing of the sleep and wake cycle generated by the endogenous circadian clock and that of the sleep and wake pattern required by transmeridian travel across at least two time zones. Individuals complain of disturbed sleep, sleepiness and fatigue, somatic symptoms (e.g. gastrointestinal distress) or impaired daytime function. The severity and duration of symptoms is dependent on the number of time zones traveled, the ability to sleep while traveling, exposure to appropriate circadian times cues in the new environment, tolerance to circadian misalignment when awake during the biological night, and the direction of the travel. The symptoms result in significant distress or mental, physical, social, occupational or academic impairment."
1980306606,7A26,Insufficient sleep syndrome,"Insufficient sleep syndrome occurs when an individual persistently fails to obtain the amount of sleep required relative to their own physiological sleep requirements to maintain normal levels of alertness and wakefulness and is thus chronically sleep deprived. The curtailed sleep pattern is present most days for at least several months.

The person’s ability to initiate and maintain sleep is unimpaired. Sleep time is often markedly extended on weekend nights or during holidays compared to weekday. Extension of total sleep time results in resolution of the symptoms of sleepiness."
843691445,7A42.6,Sleep-related hypoxemia due to a medical condition,"Sleep related hypoxemia due to a medical condition is characterised by sustained declines in SpO2 (≤ 88% in adults or ≤ 90% in children) for ≥ 5 minutes) during sleep. The condition is attributable to a medical or neurological disorder. The presence of hypoxemia is not better explained by another sleep related breathing disorder (e.g., obstructive sleep apnoea). Although some amount of obstructive or central apnoea may be present, these disorders are not thought to be primarily responsible for the hypoxemia during sleep. Some patients with sleep related hypoxemia also exhibit hypoxemia during wakefulness. If the presence of hypercapnia has been established, a diagnosis of sleep-related hypoventilation should be made, rather than sleep-related hypoxemia.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnographic monitoring of oxygen saturation (SaO2) in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the declines in SaO2."
329728491,7B01.0,REM sleep behaviour disorder,"REM sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by repeated episodes of sleep related vocalization or complex motor behaviours that are either documented by polysomnography to occur during REM sleep or are presumed to occur during REM sleep due to a clinical history of dream enactment. Polysomnographic recording (when performed) demonstrates REM sleep without atonia. The disorder may occur as an isolated, idiopathic form but is frequently associated with latent or manifest disease of the nervous system, especially alpha-synucleinopathies.

Note: A provisional diagnosis may be established on clinical grounds but definitive diagnosis requires polysomnographic demonstration of REM sleep without atonia."
756278911,7A64,"Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, shift work type","Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, shift work type is characterised by complaints of insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness that occur as a result of work shifts that overlap with all or a portion of conventional nighttime sleep periods. The disorder is also associated with a reduction in total sleep time. The symptoms should have persisted for at least several months and result in significant distress or mental, physical, social, occupational or academic impairment."
2088456351,7A23,Hypersomnia due to a medical condition,"Hypersomnia due to a medical condition is characterised by excessive nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, or excessive napping of at least several months duration that is attributable to a coexisting medical or neurological disorder (e.g. head trauma, Parkinson disease, certain genetic conditions, metabolic, neurologic or endocrine disorders) and is sufficiently severe to require an independent focus of clinical attention. Hypersomnia due to a medical condition is only diagnosed if the hypersomnia is a direct physiological consequence of the medical condition. Residual sleepiness in patients with adequately-treated obstructive sleep apnoea is classified here under the assumption that it is due to central nervous system damage from recurrent hypoxemia.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires use of polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) to rule out other hypersomnolence disorders or other sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) which might better explain the sleepiness."
1393951214,7B02.0,Hypnagogic exploding head syndrome,"Hypnagogic exploding head syndrome is characterised by the perception of a sudden, loud noise or sense of a violent explosion in the head that typically occurs as the individual is falling asleep. On occasion, these episodes may occur with awakening during the night. They are associated with abrupt arousal following the event, often with a sense of fright."
1553662423,7A40.7,Treatment-emergent central sleep apnoea,"Treatment-emergent central sleep apnoea is characterised by persistence or emergence of recurrent, predominantly central sleep apnoea (more than five per hour) during effective treatment for obstructive apnoea (obstructive or mixed apnoea or hypopnea) with positive airway pressure. Central apnoeas must be the predominant finding (>50% of total respiratory events). The disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnea, or snoring. If the reduction or cessation of airflow due to absent or reduced respiratory effort is better explained by another central sleep apnoea disorder (e.g., Central sleep apnoea due to a medication or substance), that diagnosis along with a diagnosis of Obstructive sleep apnoea should be given, rather than a diagnosis of treatment-emergent central sleep apnoea.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
1743751621,7B00.1,Sleepwalking disorder,Sleepwalking disorder is characterised by ambulation and other complex behaviours during a partial arousal from deep sleep.
1359329403,,Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders,"Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle (typically manifest as insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both) due to alterations of the circadian time-keeping system, its entrainment mechanisms, or a misalignment of the endogenous circadian rhythm and the external environment. Sleep logs and, if possible, actigraphy for a minimum of one week should be utilized to define the specific sleep-wake schedule disturbance."
631826564,7A21,Idiopathic hypersomnia,"Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterised by daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep occurring for at least several months in the absence of cataplexy or hypocretin deficiency (if determined). Polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) findings characteristic of narcolepsy (i.e., two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP’s), or one or more SOREMP’s on MSLT and a SOREMP on the preceding overnight polysomnography) should also be absent. The daytime sleepiness is not better explained by another disorder (e.g., insufficient sleep syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), a substance or medication, or a medical condition). Objective evidence of hypersomnolence is indicated by an MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes or by polysomnography or wrist actigraphy showing a total 24-hour sleep time of 11 hours or more. Prolonged and severe sleep inertia is often observed and consists of sustained difficulty waking up with repeated returns to sleep, irritability, automatic behaviour, and confusion. In contrast to narcolepsy, naps are generally long, often more than 60 minutes, and unrefreshing.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep, objective demonstration of excessive sleepiness and absence of REM-related findings by multiple sleep latency test (MSLT/PSG)."
873001259,7B02.3,Parasomnia disorder due to a medication or substance,"Parasomnia disorder due to a medication or substance is characterised by abnormal sleep related complex movements, behaviours, emotions, perceptions, dreams, and autonomic nervous system activity that are directly attrib¬utable to the effect of a medication or substance."
1009451323,7A82,Sleep-related leg cramps,"Sleep related leg cramps are painful sensations in the leg or foot associated with sudden, involuntary muscle hardness or tightness, indicating a strong muscle contraction. They typically last from a few seconds to several minutes. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep)."
1750742010,7A42.1,Congenital central alveolar sleep-related hypoventilation,"Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of autonomic dysfunction, primarily the failure of automatic central control of breathing, caused by a mutation of the PHOX2B gene. CCHS is characterised by hypoventilation, which is worse during sleep than wakefulness. Onset is usually at birth, and CCHS most commonly presents in an otherwise normal-appearing infant who is noted to have cyanosis, feeding difficulties, hypotonia or, less commonly, central apnoea. Severity is related to the specific mutation present. Individuals with milder variants of the disorder may not present for clinical attention until adulthood.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of PHOX2B mutation and objective evidence based on polysomnography with carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring (by arterial, end-tidal or transcutaneous measures)."
1851015159,7A20.0,"Narcolepsy, Type 1","Type 1 narcolepsy is a disorder of excessive sleepiness due to a deficiency of hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) signaling. In addition to daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep, type 1 narcolepsy is characterised by symptoms of REM sleep dissociation, most importantly cataplexy. Cataplexy is a sudden and uncontrollable loss of muscle tone arising during wakefulness that is typically triggered by a strong emotion, such as excitement or laughter. Although cataplexy is a pathognomonic symptom of type 1 narcolepsy, it may not manifest until years following onset of the sleepiness. In such cases, a diagnosis of narcolepsy, type 1 may be made based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-hypocretin levels < 110 picograms per milliliter. Episodes of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations may also be present. The disorder is not attributable to a disease of the nervous system or other medical condition.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep plus either: a) cataplexy and multiple sleep latency test/polysomnography (MSLT/PSG) findings characteristic of narcolepsy; or b) demonstrated CSF hypocretin deficiency."
1930903815,7A25,Hypersomnia associated with a mental disorder,"Hypersomnia associated with a mental disorder is characterised by excessive nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, or excessive napping that is sufficiently severe to constitute an independent focus of clinical attention. This is most typical of depressive disorders or the depressed phase of bipolar disorders. Patients often feel that their sleep is of poor quality and nonrestorative and may be intensely focused on their hypersomnolence. Objective evidence of excessive sleepiness on MSLT is often absent.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires use of polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) to rule out other hypersomnolence disorders or other sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) which might better explain the sleepiness."
582567115,7A40.5,Central sleep apnoea due to high-altitude periodic breathing,"High-altitude periodic breathing is characterised by alternating periods of central apnoea and hyperpnoea associated with recent ascent to high altitude (typically > 2500 meters). The pattern of periodic breathing is an expected response to ascent to elevation. The disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnoea, or snoring. The cycle length of this respiratory pattern is commonly less than 40 seconds and often as short as 12 to 20 seconds.

Note: This diagnosis can be made clinically based on symptoms and recent ascent to high altitude."
883900763,7B00,Disorders of arousal from non-REM sleep,"Disorders of arousal from non-REM sleep are characterised by experiences or behaviours such as confusion, ambulation, terror, or extreme autonomic arousal that typically arise as a result of incomplete arousals from deep non-REM (N3) sleep. An exception is sleep-related eating disorder, which has been observed to arise during all stages of non-REM sleep. This group of disorders is also characterised by partial or complete amnesia for the event, inappropriate or absent responsiveness to efforts by others to intervene or redirect the person during the episode, and limited (e.g., a single visual scene) or no associated cognition or dream imagery. The experiences or behaviours are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning or significant risk of injury to the individual or to others (e.g., thrashing or striking out in response to efforts to restrain the individual)."
138101549,7A61,Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder,"Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder is a recurrent pattern of disturbance of the sleep-wake schedule characterised by persistent advance (to an earlier time) of the major sleep period compared to conventional or desired sleep times. The disorder results in evening sleepiness (prior to the desired bedtime) and awakening earlier than the desired or required times. When sleep is allowed to occur on the advanced schedule, it is essentially normal in quality and duration. The symptoms should have persisted for at least several months and result in significant distress or mental, physical, social, occupational or academic impairment."
1024837047,7A42.3,Idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation,"Idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation is defined as the presence of decreased alveolar ventilation resulting in sleep related hypercapnia and hypoxemia in individuals with presumed normal mechanical properties of the lung and respiratory pump. Chronic hypoventilation during sleep exists without any readily identifiable impairments of respiration, such as pulmonary airway or parenchymal conditions, neurologic, neuromuscular or chest wall abnormalities, severe obesity, other sleep related breathing disorder, or use of respiratory depressant medications or substances. Diurnal as well as nocturnal hypoventilation is believed to be due primarily to blunted chemoresponsiveness to carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). Patients may complain of morning headaches, fatigue, neurocognitive decline and sleep disturbance, or may be entirely asymptomatic.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography with carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring (by arterial, end-tidal or transcutaneous measures)."
323148092,7A00,Chronic insomnia,"Chronic insomnia is a frequent and persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep and that results in general sleep dissatisfaction and some form of daytime impairment. Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur at least several times per week for at least 3 months. Some individuals with chronic insomnia may show a more episodic course, with recurrent episodes of sleep/wake difficulties lasting several weeks at a time over several years. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder. If the insomnia is due to another sleep-wake disorder, a mental disorder, another medical condition, or a substance or medication, chronic insomnia should only be diagnosed if the insomnia is an independent focus of clinical attention."
151357345,,Parasomnia disorders,"Parasomnias are problematic behavioural or physiological events that occur while falling asleep, during sleep, or upon arousal from sleep. Parasomnias may occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), or during transitions to and from sleep. They encompass abnormal sleep related complex movements, behaviours, emotions, perceptions, dreams, and autonomic nervous system activity."
1822188276,7B01.1,Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis,Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis consists of recurrent inability to move the trunk and all of the limbs at sleep onset (hypnagogic) or upon awakening (hypnopompic) from sleep. Episodes typically last from a few seconds to a few minutes and cause clinically significant distress including bedtime anxiety or fear of sleep.
274880002,07,Sleep-wake disorders,"Sleep-wake disorders are characterised by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (insomnia disorders), excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence disorders), respiratory disturbance during sleep (sleep-related breathing disorders), disorders of the sleep-wake schedule (circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders), abnormal movements during sleep (sleep-related movement disorders), or problematic behavioural or physiological events that occur while falling asleep, during sleep, or upon arousal from sleep (parasomnia disorders)."
1762655612,7B02.1,Sleep-related hallucinations,"Sleep related hallucinations are hallucinatory experiences that occur at sleep onset (hypnagogic hallucinations) or on awakening from sleep (hypnopompic hallucinations). Sleep related hallucinations are predominantly visual but may include auditory, tactile, or kinetic phenomena."
300740103,7A24,Hypersomnia due to a medication or substance,"Hypersomnia due to a medication or substance is characterised by excessive nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, or excessive napping that is attributable to the sedating effects of medications, alcohol, or other psychoactive substances, including withdrawal syndromes (e.g., from stimulants) and is sufficiently severe to constitute an independent focus of clinical attention.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires use of polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) to rule out other hypersomnolence disorders or other sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) which might better explain the sleepiness."
2113831613,7A87,Sleep-related movement disorder due to a medical condition,"Sleep-related movement disorder due to a medical condition is characterised by sleep-related movement abnormalities that are directly attrib¬utable to an underlying neurological or medical condition. Many medical conditions, particularly diseases of the nervous system, may be associated with movement abnormali¬ties that are evident in wake and sleep. In some cases, the nocturnal manifestations of the movement abnormalities may be apparent before establishment of a firm neurological diagnosis. Once the pres¬ence of a medical or neurological condition is clearly established, this diagnosis should only be assigned if the sleep-related aspects of the movement abnormality or its sequelae are the focus of independent clinical attention."
612376701,7A40.3,Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition with Cheyne-Stokes breathing,"Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition with Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterised by recurrent, predominantly central apnoeas or central hypopneas (more than five per hour) alternating with a respiratory phase exhibiting a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of flow (or tidal volume) that are attributed to a medical condition. The longer cycle length (> 40 seconds) distinguishes Central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing from other central sleep apnoea types. The vast majority of patients with Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition with Cheyne-Stokes breathing have either systolic or diastolic heart failure. Patients with Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition with Cheyne-Stokes breathing have normal or low daytime arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The disturbance is typically associated with atrial fibrillation/flutter, congestive heart failure, or a neurological disorder and is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnoea, or snoring.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the symptoms."
1038292737,,Insomnia disorders,"Insomnia disorders are characterised by the complaint of persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder."
1846518306,7A81,Periodic limb movement disorder,"Periodic limb movement disorder is characterised by periodic episodes of repetitive (> 5/hour in children or > 15/hour in adults), highly stereotyped limb movements that occur during sleep, in conjunction with significant difficulties with sleep initiation or maintenance or fatigue that cannot be accounted for by another primary sleep disorder or other etiology. Specifically, when periodic limb movements are associated with Restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy or REM sleep behaviour disorder, a separate diagnosis of Periodic limb movement disorder is not warranted because the limb movements during sleep are considered an expected part of these disorders. Periodic limb movements occur most frequently in the lower extremities but may be seen in the arms as well. They may be associated with recurrent arousal from sleep, which gives rise to sleep disruption. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
756998404,7A86,Propriospinal myoclonus at sleep onset,"Propriospinal myoclonus at sleep onset consists of sudden myoclonic jerks of the trunk, hips, and knees in a fixed pattern that occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and, more rarely, during nighttime awakenings or upon awakening in the morning. The jerks arise mainly in spinally innervated muscles and thereafter propagate to rostral and caudal muscles at a low speed, typical of propriospinal pathways. The movements result in clinically significant difficulty with sleep initiation or maintenance."
49589409,,Sleep-related movement disorders,"Sleep related movement disorders are primarily characterised by relatively simple, usually stereotyped, movements that disturb sleep or its onset. An exception is Restless legs syndrome, which is primarily a waking, sensorimotor experience but is included in Sleep-related movement disorders because it almost always also involves periodic limb movements during sleep."
158240175,7A88,Sleep-related movement disorder due to a medication or substance,"Sleep-related movement disorder due to a medication or substance is characterised by sleep-related movement abnormalities that are directly attributable to the effect of a medication or substance. Many substances may be associated with movement abnormalities that are evident in wake and sleep. To the extent that the movement abnormality is an expected complication of the substance(s) involved (e.g., tardive dyskinesia or akathisia associated with neuroleptic usage), this diagnosis should only be assigned if the sleep-related aspects of the movement abnormality or its sequelae are the focus of independent clinical attention."
2024456840,,Hypersomnolence disorders,"Hypersomnolence disorders are characterised by a complaint of daytime sleepiness that is not due to another sleep-wake disorder (e.g. disturbed nocturnal sleep, misaligned circadian rhythm, or breathing disorder).

Daytime hypercapnia may also be present. Sleep related hypoxemia may be severe. Patients can either be asymptomatic or present with complaints of dyspnea, chest tightness, or fatigue.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography with carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring (by arterial, end-tidal or transcutaneous measures) in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the symptoms."
139667543,7A40.1,Primary central sleep apnoea of infancy,"Primary central sleep apnoea of infancy is characterised by prolonged (> 20 seconds), predominantly central apnoeas or periodic breathing during more than 5% of total sleep time in an infant of at least 37 weeks conceptional age. These events are typically associated with physiological compromise (hypoxemia, bradycardia), or the need for intervention such as stimulation or resuscitation. This diagnosis should be assigned when central events are the predominant finding, even if obstructive or mixed apnoeas or hypopneas are also present.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography or alternative monitoring such as hospital or home monitoring."
60908067,7A83,Sleep-related bruxism,"Sleep-related bruxism is characterised by repetitive, rhythmic jaw muscle contractions that occur during sleep These contractions can take the form of a repetitive phasic muscle contractions or isolated sustained jaw clenching (tonic contractions).

Clinically, HSPs can be divided into two main groups: uncomplicated (pure) and complicated (complex) forms depending on the presence of other neurological features including ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, amyotrophy, retinopathy, deafness, ichthyosis and extrapyramidal involvement, in addition to spastic paraparesis. Pure HSPs are characterised by slowly progressive lower extremity spasticity and weakness, often associated with hypertonic urinary disturbances, mild reduction of lower extremity vibration sense and, occasionally, of joint position sensation. Complex HSP forms are characterised by the presence of additional neurological or non-neurological features. A positive family history particularly in autosomal dominant cases is often but not always present. The diagnosis may be aided by neuroimaging and genetic testing."

496011112,8E4A.0,"Paraneoplastic or autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system, brain or spinal cord","Paraneoplastic and autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system, brain and spinal cord nervous system result from a targeted immune attack on neurons or glial cells in the central (e.g. encephalopathy, ataxia, myelopathy, myelitis) nervous system. In the paraneoplastic context, this attack is a consequence of a potentially effective tumour immune response initiated by onco-neural antigens derived from a systemic cancer. In the non-paraneoplastic context termed ‘autoimmune’ the etiology remains elusive though increasing evidence indicates a preceding infectious trigger in at least some cases. These disorders are commonly multifocal causing injury and symptoms arising from involvement at many levels of the central nervous system. A personal or family history of autoimmunity is often found. Accompanying neural and non-organ specific (thyroid peroxidase [TPO] antibodies) autoantibodies may be found. The neural autoantibody profile may be predictive of a specific cancer type and may be associated with a particular neurological phenotype. Exclusion of alternative etiologies (e.g. infections) is important. Response to immunotherapy may support the diagnosis."

The table below gives a classification of severity of vision impairment based on visual acuity. 
For epidemiological studies, it is recommended to collect the following information on visual acuity for each eye, for both eyes open and for distance and near. 
  a) Uncorrected visual acuity 
  b) Presenting visual acuity 
  c) Best corrected visual acuity 

Blindness is also categorized according to the degree of constriction of the central visual field in the better eye to less than 10 degrees. 

For capturing and coding of “No vision impairment”, use QA00.62 (QA00.6 Examination of eyes or vision).

There is progressive systolic impairment with ventricular dilation and marked propensity for ventricular arrhythmias of right, as well as left, ventricular origin. Classically a disease of the right ventricle, more recent evidence suggests left ventricular involvement to a varying extent in up to 75% of cases, as well as isolated left ventricular disease.

Additional information: Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (AVC/D) is a heart muscle disease clinically characterised by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Its prevalence has been estimated to vary from 1:2,500 to 1:5,000 and is a major cause of sudden death in the young and in athletes. Classically a disease of the right ventricle, more recent evidence suggests left ventricular involvement to a varying extent in up to 75% of cases, as well as isolated left ventricular disease. The clinical picture may include: a subclinical phase without symptoms and with ventricular fibrillation being the first presentation; an electrical disorder with palpitations and syncope, due to tachyarrhythmias of right ventricular origin (left bundle branch block pattern) but also of left ventricular origin (right bundle branch block pattern) when left ventricular disease present; right ventricular or biventricular pump failure, so severe as to require transplantation. The pathology consists of a genetically determined dystrophy of the right (or left) ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement which may lead to right ventricular aneurysms. The causative genes (ACTN2, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, TMEM43, LDB3, PKP2, RYR2, TGFB3) encode proteins of mechanical cell junctions (plakoglobin, plakophilin, desmoglein, desmocollin, desmoplakin) and account for intercalated disk remodelling. Familial occurrence with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance has been reported. Recessive variants associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair (see these terms) have also been described. Classically clinical diagnosis depends on demonstrating functional and structural alterations of the right ventricle (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging), ECG depolarization and repolarization abnormalities, arrhythmias with the left bundle branch block morphology and fibro-fatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. Electroanatomic mapping is able to detect areas of low voltage corresponding to myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty replacement. The main differential diagnoses are idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy and sarcoidosis (see these terms). Management includes antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Young age, family history of juvenile sudden death, QRS dispersion greater than or equal to 340 ms, T-wave inversion, left ventricular involvement, ventricular tachycardia, syncope and prior cardiac arrest are the major risk factors for an adverse prognosis."
1018829714,BC42,Myocarditis,"Myocarditis (inflammatory cardiomyopathy) is inflammation of the heart muscle generally in the presence of a dilated cardiomyopathy that results from exposure to either discrete infectious external antigens such as viruses, bacteria, fungae or parasites; non-infectious external antigens such as hypersensitivity to drugs; or internal non-infectious triggers such as autoimmune or hypersensitive activation against self-antigens.

Additional information: The classic Dallas criteria for the pathological diagnosis of myocarditis require the presence of inflammatory cells simultaneously with evidence of myocyte necrosis on the same microscopic section when examining a myocardial biopsy. Borderline myocarditis is characterised by inflammatory cell infiltrate without myocardial necrosis. A negative biopsy does not necessarily rule out myocarditis."

Allergic rhinitis is an inflammation of nasal airway triggered by allergens to which the affected individual has previously been sensitized. Pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis is type I allergy on the nasal mucosa. Antigens inhaled into sensitized nasal mucosa bind to IgE antibodies on mast cells, which release chemical mediators such as histamine and peptide leukotriene. Consequently terminal of sensory neurons and vessels react to induce sneezing, running nose, and stuffy nose (immediate phase reaction). In late phase reaction, various chemical mediators are produced by mast cells, cytokines are produced by Th2 and mast cells, and chemokines are produced by epithelial cells, endothelium of blood vessels, and fibrocytes, respectively. These cell-derived transmitters actually induce various cell types of inflammatory cell infiltration to nasal mucosa. Among them, activated eosinophils is the main player of mucosal swelling and hyperreactivity.

It is thought to be due to spontaneous rupture of subpleural apical blebs or bullae that result from smoking or that are inherited. It generally occurs at rest, although some cases occur during activities involving reaching or stretching. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs during diving and high-altitude flying because of unequally transmitted pressure changes in the lung. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. It most often results from rupture of a bleb or bulla in patients with severe COPD, HIV-related Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, cystic fibrosis, or any underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is more serious than primary spontaneous pneumothorax because it occurs in patients whose underlying lung disease decreases their pulmonary reserve."

1836987572,CA0A,Chronic rhinosinusitis,"Sinusitis is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses secondary to both infectious and allergic mechanisms. The retention of sinus secretions is the most important event in the development of sinusitis. This creates a favourable milieu for the growth of infection agents and may be caused by the obstruction or narrowing of sinus ostia, mucociliary dysfunction and changes in mucus composition. 90% of sinus infections involve the maxillary sinus. Chronic sinusitis refers to symptom duration lasting 3 months or more. Diagnosis of sinusitis is based on past history and physical examination findings. The CT scan is the most sensitive technique in evaluating sinus disease. The goals of management of chronic sinusitis are to eradicate infection, to relieve ostiomeatal obstruction, to normalize mucociliary clearance, and to prevent complications. When pharmaceutical treatment does not have any remarkable improvement or when a surgical approach can be chosen as patient's complication, surgical intervention should be aimed to establish an effective sinus drainage from the ostium. . Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) describes endoscopic techniques that have revolutionized the approach to sinus disease.

Intestinal atresia is one of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in the newborn. The ileal atresia is more common than jejunal atresia, and multiple foci are more common than isolated atresia. The most accepted theory regarding the etiology of jejunoileal atresia is that of an intrauterine vascular accident resulting in necrosis of the affected segment.
Stenosis, on the other hand, refers to a partial occlusion with incomplete obstruction and accounts for the remaining 5% of cases. A stenosis has an intact mesentery and is a localised narrowing of the bowel. No loss of continuity of the lumen exists."

2023258628,LA88.41,Perimembranous central ventricular septal defect,"A congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is a ventricular septal defect that 1) occupies the space that is usually closed by the interventricular part of the membranous septum, 2) is usually adjacent to the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of an atrioventricular valve and an arterial valve, 3) is adjacent to an area of mitral-tricuspid fibrous continuity, and 4) is located at the center of the base of the ventricular mass.

Additional information: This code is used by some as synonymous with the perimembranous, conoventricular, Type II, or the paramembranous defects. Although best used to describe the perimembranous defect that opens centrally at the base of the right ventricle, this term might be used to code perimembranous defects with inlet or outlet extension. It is recommended, however, that the more precise terms be used whenever possible for coding the latter lesions. It should also not be used to code an inlet ventricular septal defect, or the so-called atrioventricular canal ventricular septal defect. More specific terms exist for coding these entities. It is used by some to describe an isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defect without extension, although it is unlikely that perimembranous defects exist in the absence of deficiency of their muscular perimeter. The conoventricular ventricular septal defect with malalignment should be coded as an outlet defect, as should the perimembranous defect opening to the outlet of the right ventricle. Such defects can also extend to become doubly committed and juxta-arterial (conal septal hypoplasia) when there is also fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial valves or when there is a common arterial valve. Specific codes exist for these variants, which ideally should not be coded using this term."

Evidence of a preceding seizure may be present or not. A “definite SUDEP” is confirmed if a postmortem examination does not reveal an alternative cause of death. If such examination lacks, but potentially lethal alternative causes are excluded and all other criteria are met, the death is labelled as “probable SUDEP”. The term “possible SUDEP” is used in cases with competing causes of death or when data are insufficient to reasonably allow their classification. The term “SUDEP plus” applies when a patient also suffered from other diseases that may have contributed to the death, but there are no clues that the alternative condition has truly caused it. Cases in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation prevented the death are called “near-SUDEP”."

1640181609,MG30.11,Chronic post cancer treatment pain,"Chronic post-cancer treatment pain is pain caused by any treatment given to treat the primary tumour or metastases. The most common forms are:

(i) Chronic painful chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (CIPN): chronic peripheral neuropathic pain caused by oral or intravenous chemotherapy.

(ii) Chronic post-radiotherapy pain: chronic pain caused by delayed local damage to the nervous system in the field of radiotherapy. It is distinct from pain caused by tumour recurrence or co-morbid disease.

Other treatments include surgery and hormonal therapy.


Diagnostic Criteria 
Conditions A to C are fulfilled:

A. Chronic pain (persistent or recurrent for longer than 3 months) is present and characterised by all of the following:
A1 History of treatment with neurotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or any treatment given to treat the primary tumour or metastases
A2 It is likely that the pain is caused by the cancer treatment.

B. One of the following applies:
B1 An active or recurrent tumour or metastases have been specifically excluded on radiological investigation.
B2 If an active or a recurrent tumor or metastases are present, the pain is not better accounted for by them.

C. The pain is not better accounted for by another diagnosis of chronic pain."

Clinical findings include those found using physical, laboratory and imaging techniques. 

Diseases can manifest in many ways and in different body systems. Such specific manifestations may be a reason for treatment or encounter, with or without identifying or addressing the underlying condition.  
Categories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, could be designated 'not otherwise specified', 'unknown aetiology' or 'transient'.

The conditions and signs or symptoms included in this chapter consist of:

  - cases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated
  - signs or symptoms existing at the time of initial encounter that proved to be transient and whose causes could not be determined;
  - provisional diagnoses in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care;
  - cases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made;
  - cases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason; 
  - certain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right.

These categories should be used in conjunction with a code from another chapter that identifies the underlying condition."

In the ICD, injury means physical or physiological bodily harm resulting from interaction of the body with energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical or radiant, or due to extreme pressure) in an amount, or at a rate of transfer, that exceeds physical or physiological tolerance. Injury can also result from lack of vital elements, such as oxygen. Poisoning by and toxic effects of substances are included, as is damage of or due to implanted devices.  

Injury usually has rapid onset in response to a well-defined event (e.g. a car crash, striking the ground after falling, drinking a strongly alkaline liquid, an overdose of a medication, a burn sustained during a surgical procedure). These events are often referred to as external causes of injury. The injurious energy can, however, originate from the injured person and/or from his or her immediate environment (e.g. a person running on a hot day sustains heat exhaustion), and injury can be caused by the injured person (i.e. intentional self-harm).

Injury includes manifestations that are evident immediately after onset, which may persist or not, and manifestations that first become evident at a later date."

The mandibular condylar process comprises three fracture levels and is subdivided into the head region, the condylar neck, and the condylar base. Fractures of the condylar head show typical fracture lines either within the lateral pole zone, which may lead to loss of vertical height, or medially to the pole zone, with the latter ones usually not compromising the vertical condyle to disc and fossa relation. Fractures of the condylar neck and base can be differentiated according to radiologically based rules with regard to the proportion of the fracture line above and below the level of the sigmoid notch, and are basically subdivided according to the presence or absence of displacement or dislocation. Further parameters for definition are presence or absence of fragmentation, sideward displacement (medially or laterally), angulation of the superior main fragment and fracture-site geometry (e.g. straight or oblique, interfragmentary interdigitation)"

The WHO definition of an ‘injury’ is: ‘Injuries are caused by acute exposure to physical agents such as mechanical energy, heat, electricity, chemicals, and ionizing radiation interacting with the body in amounts or at rates that exceed the threshold of human tolerance. In some cases, (for example, drowning and frostbite), injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat’.
Injuries may be categorized in a number of ways. However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorize injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are:

- unintentional (i.e. accidental)
- intentional (i.e. deliberate):
- interpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide)
- self-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide)
- legal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel)
- war, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots)
- undetermined intent

Regarding the collection of events that cause injuries, a set of definitions apply. See section ‘Definition related to transport accidents’."

2.	When some circumstance or problem is present which influences the person's health status but is not in itself a current illness or injury. Such circumstance or problem may be elicited during population surveys, when the person may or may not be currently sick, or be recorded as additional information to be borne in mind when the person is receiving care for some illness or injury."

This subsection includes the domains and questions for use with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) 36 item version. The WHODAS 2.0 captures an individual’s level of functioning in six major life domains of the “activity and participation” dimension: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities and participation in society. For all domains, the WHODAS 2.0 36-item version provides domain-specific and overall summary score of functioning. 
The table below provides the classification of severity of the functioning problem, based on the response received to the question related to the relevant functioning category. 
For coding, the relevant additional digit is added after the decimal point to the code of the relevant functioning category.

The code for the presence of psychosocial factors is appropriate when there is positive evidence that psychological or social factors contribute to the cause, the maintenance or the exacerbation of the health condition, or associated disability, or when the health condition results in negative psychobehavioral consequences (eg, demoralisation, hopelessness, avoidance, withdrawal). Assigning this extension code does not require a judgement regarding aetiological contributions or causal priorities."
